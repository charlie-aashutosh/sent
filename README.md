# Sentiment Analysis App

This is a simple Sentiment Analysis application that can be hosted on GitHub Pages. It uses basic JavaScript to analyze the sentiment of a given text input.

## Features

- Analyze text to determine if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Hosted as a static site on GitHub Pages.

## How It Works

The app uses a basic word matching technique to determine sentiment. It checks for the presence of positive and negative words in the input text and calculates a score based on these words.

- **Positive Words**: good, amazing, great, happy, love
- **Negative Words**: bad, terrible, sad, hate, poor

The sentiment is determined as follows:
- Positive Sentiment: Score > 0
- Negative Sentiment: Score < 0
- Neutral Sentiment: Score = 0
